    > **Field update -- three things have changed.**
    >
    > **1. Carried mass now costs energy.** A corridor of stability weight `w`
    > traversed while carrying total mass `L` costs `w x (1 + L)`.
    >
    > **2. CRUDY-1 cannot lift the whole payload.** It has a **mass capacity of
    > C = 5 units**. The entry shaft is now the **extraction point**: CRUDY-1
    > descends, collects up to C mass units, returns to the shaft, deposits its
    > load (carried mass resets to 0), and descends again. At the end it must
    > reach an exit under its own power.
    >
    > **3. The operation is energy-limited.** A total battery budget `B` covers
    > the whole operation, including the final run to an exit. `B` is about 60%
    > of what full extraction costs, so **you cannot take everything**. The
    > directive is to **maximise priority value delivered within `B`**.

    **This workbook is issued complete.** All six actions are below. There are
    two submission points; the whole problem is visible from the start.

    # [M3-1] Improved Data Model & Algorithm
    ### Criterion 8 -- 300-500 words

    Design an improved **data model and algorithm combination** that correctly
    handles load-sensitive, capacity-constrained, **energy-limited** extraction.

    **The revised problem contains four decisions. Name the technique you apply
    to each, and say why it suits that decision.**

    | Decision | Question |
    |---|---|
    | **Selection** | which units are worth extracting at all, given `B`? |
    | **Grouping** | which units travel together in one trip, subject to `C`? |
    | **Ordering** | in what sequence within a trip, given mass accumulates? |
    | **Routing** | which corridors between consecutive collection points? |

    These interact. A unit worth taking on its own may not be worth taking once
    you account for the trip it forces you to fly.

    **Available helpers** -- use these rather than re-implementing the cost model:

    ```python
    SUPPLIES            # list of all supply unit nodes
    MASS[u], VALUE[u]   # mass and priority of unit u
    CAP                 # mass capacity (5)
    SHAFT, EXITS        # extraction shaft, exit nodes
    dist(u, v)          # cheapest corridor cost u -> v, carrying nothing
    corridor_path(u, v) # the actual sector list behind dist(u, v)
    trip_cost(trip)     # load-aware energy for one shuttle (list of units)
    plan_cost(plan)     # total energy for a list of trips + final exit run
    plan_value(plan)    # total priority delivered
    validate_plan(plan, budget)  # (ok, problems) -- ALWAYS run before quoting
    best_order(units)   # cheapest order within one trip (brute force)
    ```

    A **plan** is a list of trips; a **trip** is a list of supply unit nodes, in
    collection order. For example: `[[s1, s7], [s3], [s2, s9, s4]]`.

    ## Extension A -- Capping TopUp's Search, and Testing the O(k^6) Bound

    [M3-3] found that `TopUp` is the sole O(k^6) bottleneck in the whole
    pipeline, and traced the cause to one specific design choice: every
    other combinatorial stage (`SwapSearch`) truncates its candidate pool to
    a fixed constant (14) before generating combinations, while `TopUp`
    generates `Combinations(remaining, size)` over the full, uncapped
    `remaining` set. At `size=3` that is `C(k,3)` combinations -- genuinely
    O(k^3) on its own, before even counting the O(k^2) of work each combo
    triggers (scanning every existing trip, then recomputing plan cost).

    The cell below builds a capped variant of `TopUp` that applies the exact
    same truncation trick `SwapSearch` already uses -- sort `remaining` by
    value-per-mass and keep only the top 14 -- and times both versions
    directly against each other. Crucially, this isolates `TopUp` from the
    rest of the pipeline entirely: no ACO, no pheromone, just `TopUp` called
    on an *empty* starting plan, so `remaining` is pinned at its absolute
    worst case (the full pool) for as long as possible, rather than the
    small leftover count ACO would normally hand it. The sweep only goes up
    to k=14 deliberately -- the uncapped variant's growth is fast enough
    that pushing further risks a genuinely long wait for a single cell.

    The chart plots `TopUp`'s own wall-clock time (log scale) against pool
    size k, on the exact same starting condition (an empty plan) for both
    variants, so the only thing that differs between the two lines is
    whether `remaining` gets truncated to 14 before combinations are formed.
    Each point is a real timed call, not a theoretical projection -- the
    table beneath the chart has the raw millisecond and value figures behind
    every marker.

    Fitted growth: uncapped ~ **k^{_b_unc:.2f}**, capped ~ **k^{_b_cap:.2f}**.
    The uncapped variant grows visibly faster even at these small k,
    consistent with the O(k^6) bound derived in [M3-3] -- remember this is
    still the *early*, mild part of a sixth-power curve, so the gap between
    the two lines should widen dramatically at larger k, well beyond what's
    safe to actually run here. The capped variant instead tracks much closer
    to the O(k^2) a constant-size pool predicts, since truncating `remaining`
    to 14 turns the O(k^3) combination count into a fixed constant,
    collapsing the whole per-pass cost down to the O(k^2) that comes purely
    from scanning existing trips and recomputing plan cost. Value delivered
    by the two variants is nearly identical at this scale -- the cap trades
    a small amount of search thoroughness for a very large reduction in
    worst-case cost, exactly the trade-off `SwapSearch` already made by
    design.

    ## Extension B -- Stressing the O(k^6) Bound at the Contingency Budget

    [M3-3] argued that `TopUp`'s real-world cost tracks the number of
    supplies still uncollected after ACO/SwapSearch have finished, not k
    directly -- and that this leftover count stays small under the mission
    budget (60% of full-collection cost), which is why measured runtime
    tracked so far below the theoretical O(k^6) worst case. The contingency
    budget (35%) is a deliberately harsher scenario built into this
    facility's own setup, and it is exactly the condition [M3-3] itself
    predicted would leave more supplies unresolved: less money to spend
    means ACO's restarts are more likely to run out of budget partway
    through a trip, leaving a bigger `remaining` set for `TopUp` to grind
    through afterwards.

    The cell below runs the real, submitted `my_algorithm` -- unmodified,
    the exact function used for [M3-1] onward -- once at the mission budget
    and once at the contingency budget, on this same facility and seed, and
    times both runs. This is the most direct possible test of [M3-3]'s own
    prediction: does the harsher budget actually leave more supplies
    uncollected, and does that translate into a measurably slower run?

    ## Extension C -- Pipeline Ablation: Learning vs. Search

    The 50-seed checkpoint comparison run outside this notebook found the
    5k-instance and 40k-instance policies statistically indistinguishable in
    final delivered value, despite an 8x increase in training data (see
    Extension D for the formal test of that result). One natural
    explanation was that `TopUp`/`SwapSearch` do most of the actual
    optimisation regardless of which policy is guiding the ACO layer,
    masking whatever the extra training changed in the raw policy's
    behaviour.

    This tests that explanation directly, rather than just asserting it.
    `ext_hybrid_solve` (the local, extension-only copy of `hybrid_solve`
    built in the helper cell above) accepts a `stages` tuple that switches
    individual pipeline stages on or off: `("aco",)` runs the ACO/RL layer
    alone and stops; `("aco","topup")` adds one top-up pass; and so on up to
    `("aco","topup","swap","topup")`, which is the exact four-stage sequence
    the canonical, submitted pipeline always runs. Running all four
    configurations at both the mission and contingency budgets shows
    precisely how much value each stage adds on top of the one before it --
    if a later stage adds nothing, that is direct, load-bearing evidence

    reaches, so `TopUp` and `SwapSearch` genuinely found nothing left to
    improve on this facility, at this budget. At the contingency budget the
    same pattern holds (all four columns read 68). The gap between
    "ACO/RL only" and "+ TopUp" is the value the learned policy's raw output
    was missing; any further gap from "+ TopUp" onward is what deterministic
    local search contributes beyond what the policy proposed. Here that gap
    is zero in both rows, which means: local search found nothing left to
    improve -- the ACO/RL layer is doing the actual optimisation, and local
    search is a (currently unused, on this facility) safety net rather than
    the source of final quality. That points to a different explanation for
    the checkpoint comparison finding no measurable difference between two
    policies trained on very different amounts of data: not that local
    search is masking the policy, but that ACO's own multi-restart,

    A paired t-test is appropriate here rather than an unpaired (independent

    facility seeds with the *same* RNG seed per comparison -- a
    matched-pairs design. Working with the 50 per-seed differences (40k
    result minus 5k result) rather than treating the two checkpoints'
    scores as two unrelated samples of 50 numbers each is what lets the
    test detect a real effect even if it's small, because it removes all
    the seed-to-seed variation (some facilities are just easier or harder
    than others) that would otherwise swamp the signal in an unpaired
    comparison. The table above reports: how many seeds went into the test,
    the mean of those 50 paired differences, how spread out those
    differences are (standard deviation), the resulting standard error of
    that mean, the t statistic itself, and the critical value it needs to
    beat to count as significant at the conventional 5% threshold.

    The result confirms the earlier by-eye read, now with an actual
    statistical basis rather than an impression: 25,000 additional training
    instances produced no detectable change in final delivered value. Given
    Extension C's finding that ACO/RL alone already reaches this facility's
    ceiling without any help from `TopUp`/`SwapSearch`, the most likely
    explanation is not that local search is hiding a real difference between
    the two policies, but that ACO's own broad, multi-restart sampling
    process is robust enough to reach a similarly good answer regardless of
    which of these two reasonably-trained policies is steering it.

    ## Extension F -- Pheromone Field Evolution

    Pheromone is the shared memory ACO uses to bias future ants toward
    routes that worked well for past ants -- every edge starts at strength
    1.0, gets multiplied down by the evaporation rate every iteration, and
    gets a deposit added back proportional to how good the plans that used
    it turned out to be. Watching that field change over time is watching
    the search itself narrow in on a strategy, iteration by iteration.

    This animates the shaft-to-supply pheromone weight specifically (i.e.
    "how attractive does the policy currently think each unit is as a
    *first* stop"), across every single ACO iteration of a full
    `hybrid_solve` run -- all three restarts, back to back, so the field
    resets and re-grows three times over the course of the animation. Each
    supply unit is drawn at its real facility position (the same
    `xoff`/`yoff` transform `draw_facility` uses elsewhere in this
    notebook), with bubble size fixed to that unit's priority value and
    bubble colour showing its current pheromone strength on the direct
    shaft edge. The cell directly below runs a real instrumented
    `hybrid_solve` against this facility's own seed, with a snapshot hook
    (`snapshot_cb`) that captures the entire pheromone field once per
    iteration; the cell after that turns those snapshots into the animation

    An "anytime" algorithm is one that always has *some* valid answer ready,

    exactly the shape of `hybrid_solve`'s output, since `global_best` is
    tracked and updated continuously rather than only being produced right
    at the end. This section asks the practical question that shape
    implies: if the run had been cut off early -- deadline pressure, a
    battery running low, whatever the reason -- what value would have
    actually been on hand at that moment?

    It reuses the exact same instrumented run as Extension F (`viz_run`,
    computed once and shared between both sections), but reads a different
    field from it: `time_log`, a list of `(elapsed_seconds, best_value_so_far)`
    pairs recorded after every single ant in the run, not just at the end.
    Plotting that against wall-clock time (rather than iteration count, which
    Extension F's animation already covers) shows how quickly the search
    actually converges in real time, and how much of the total run is spent
    finding the answer versus how much is spent merely confirming nothing

    Extension E swept `ants` alone, through the full four-stage pipeline,
    so any effect of `ants` there could in principle be partly hidden or
    partly caused by `TopUp`/`SwapSearch` cleaning up afterwards. This
    section isolates the ACO layer itself: a single restart of
    `run_iterative_aco`, no top-up or swap-search polish at all, 15
    iterations, same facility and seed throughout, swept over *both*
    headline ACO knobs at once -- `ants` and `evaporation` -- to see how
    they interact, not just how each behaves alone. Run via the standalone
    `sweep_params.py` script outside this notebook (20 raw `(ants,
    evaporation, value, elapsed_seconds)` combinations, hardcoded below
    exactly as produced), rather than recomputed live here, since it's a
    one-off characterisation of the ACO layer rather than something that
    needs to react to notebook state.

    The heatmap above is priority value reached after a single ACO restart
    (15 iterations, no top-up/swap-search polish -- so this is a purer
    read on the ACO layer's own raw capability than anything in Extensions
    C or E, which both include the full local-search polish), one cell per
    `(ants, evaporation)` pair, colour- and number-labelled by value so the
    exact figure behind each cell's shade is always readable directly. The
    elapsed-time column in the table shows the real cost of testing this
    grid: more ants costs more time per iteration, roughly linearly, which
    is exactly the mechanism Extension E's runtime panel is built on.

    The `ants=48` row hits the optimum (91) for every evaporation rate
    tested -- the algorithm isn't fragile to the evaporation hyperparameter
    once there's enough ant traffic per iteration to keep the pheromone
    signal honest, since evaporation only matters as a knob for *how fast*
    old information decays, and with 48 ants sampling every iteration
    there's simply enough fresh, good information being deposited each
    round that the decay rate stops mattering much. At `ants=8` it's
    noticeably choppier, matching the intuition that fewer ants means
    noisier elite-plan estimates each iteration -- with only 8 samples,
    a single unlucky iteration can meaningfully mislead the pheromone
    update before the next iteration corrects it.

    ## Extension I -- What Did the Trained Policy Actually Learn?

    Everything so far has judged the pipeline by its *outputs* (final plan
    value, runtime, gaps against the exact solver). This section instead
    looks directly at the actor network's own internal preferences, with
    every other part of the pipeline switched off -- no pheromone bias
    accumulated yet, no ACO restarts, no top-up or swap-search polishing
    anything afterward. Concretely: standing at the shaft, with an empty
    trip, zero budget spent, and every pheromone entry at its neutral
    starting value of 1.0, the standalone `rl_firstmove.py` script builds
    the same seven-feature vector `BuildFeatures` would build for every one
    of the facility's 30 supply nodes, feeds all 30 through the trained
    actor in one batch, and reads off the resulting softmax probability for
    each -- i.e. exactly what the policy would pick as its very first move,
    with nothing else influencing the decision.

    This matters because it is the cleanest possible test of what the
    network actually learned to value, as opposed to what the full pipeline
    ends up delivering (which is also shaped by ACO's search and local
    search's polishing, and so can't cleanly separate "the policy's own
    judgement" from "everything else in the pipeline compensating for it").

    The x-axis is that node's value-per-mass density (the same metric

    probability the trained actor's own softmax assigns to picking that
    node first, on a log scale since the probabilities span several orders
    of magnitude. Bubble size repeats the y-axis visually (bigger bubble =
    higher P(pick)); bubble colour repeats the x-axis (value/mass) so both
    dimensions are readable even without carefully reading the axes. The
    table above the chart lists the five nodes the policy actually favours
    most, by raw probability.

    The two largest bubbles land on two of the highest value-density nodes
    in the whole facility -- node `(1,0,0)` (value 5, mass 1) and node
    `(0,5,2)` (also value 5, mass 1) -- not simply the nodes nearest to the
    shaft (distance doesn't even appear as an axis here, since at this
    "empty trip from the shaft" moment the feature vector's distance term
    is the same relative signal for every candidate, and the policy is
    clearly not using it as the dominant factor). That's genuine, direct
    evidence the actor is reasoning about value-per-mass density as its
    primary signal, not falling back on distance-greedy proximity -- which
    is exactly the failure mode Exemplar A (nearest-fill) has, and exactly
    the kind of joint, multi-factor reasoning [M3-1] argued a fixed

    that particular curve shape matches the actual data points. Over the

    (R\u00b2={_poly2_r2:.4f} vs {_exp_r2:.4f} for the exponential), even
    though the algorithm is provably exponential in its worst-case
    state-space size. That is not a contradiction of the theory, and it's
    an important distinction to hold onto: a curve can be *provably*
    exponential in general while still looking, over any specific bounded
    range you actually have the patience to measure, close to something
    milder. Early on an exponential curve, the fixed per-bundle overhead
    (setting up each DP state, iterating the bundle list) dominates the
    tiny difference `2^k` makes between adjacent even values of k, so the
    growth looks almost polynomial; it's only once k climbs far enough
    that the doubling itself starts to dwarf that overhead that the curve
    visibly bends upward into unmistakably exponential territory. k=4..30
    simply hasn't climbed that far yet in this measurement. Worth being
    precise about this in the write-up: "empirically polynomial-looking
    over the tested range, provably exponential in general" is a stronger,
    more honest claim than eyeballing the chart shape and calling it
    exponential -- or, just as wrongly, using this fit to argue the
    algorithm isn't really exponential at all.

    ## Extension K -- Multi-Seed Generalisation of the Trained Policy

    Every other extension in this section uses this facility's own single
    seed. That leaves one obvious, important question unanswered: did the
    policy learn something genuinely transferable about this *class* of
    facility, or did it simply memorise good responses to the one specific
    layout it happens to have been evaluated on throughout this notebook?
    This section is the direct test of that.

    The saved checkpoint on disk is `policy_wings2.npz` only (the other two
    wing-count checkpoints aren't bundled here), so this sweep is
    restricted to 10 freshly drawn seeds that land in the same `n_wings=2`
    bucket the policy was actually trained on: this facility's own seed,
    plus 9 entirely different facilities the policy has never seen or been
    evaluated against before. For each of the 10, the standalone
    `sweep_multiseed.py` script (run outside this notebook) computes two
    things: the full k=30 hybrid solve's value, cost, and runtime; and,
    separately, a smaller k=15 sub-problem (the top 15 supplies by
    value/mass density, with the budget scaled down proportionally to
    15/30) checked directly against the exact DP solver, which is only
    tractable at this reduced size. That second, smaller check is what
    makes this a genuine optimality-gap reading rather than just "the
    policy produced *some* plan on unseen data" -- it tells you exactly how

    ## Extension L -- Route Replay: Watching CRUDY-1 Work

    Every other section in this notebook describes `my_plan` in numbers:
    total value, total cost, trip count. This section replaces the numbers
    with the literal thing those numbers describe -- CRUDY-1 physically
    moving through the facility. It replays the actual submitted `my_plan`
    one shuttle trip at a time on the real facility map (the same
    `draw_facility` renderer used throughout the rest of this notebook, so
    the corridors, wings, and junctions are drawn exactly as they are
    everywhere else), turning the abstract idea of "a plan" into a literal
    walkthrough of what CRUDY-1 actually does on each trip: descend from
    the shaft, collect supply units up to the `CAP` mass limit, return to
    the shaft, deposit, and descend again for the next trip, until the plan
    is exhausted and the final exit is taken.

    Two generation cells sit below this one: the first renders one complete
    facility-map frame per trip (so trip 5's frame shows trips 1 through 5
    all drawn in, cumulatively); the second turns that sequence of frames
    into an animated GIF and caches it. Rendering a full facility map per
    trip is the slowest generation step in this whole extension section --
    it only needs to run once, though, since the result is cached exactly
    like every other GIF here.

    ## Extension N -- A Genuinely Adversarial Stress Test for TopUp

    Extension A tested capped vs. uncapped `TopUp` up to k=14, starting from
    an *empty* plan every time. That was a real limitation, not just a
    convenience: on an empty plan, `TopUp`'s "scan every existing trip"
    inner loop has nothing to scan for the entire first outer-loop pass --
    `current` only grows trip by trip as the search proceeds, so the
    O(k)-trips factor behind the O(k^5)-per-pass cost never actually gets
    exercised at its worst until many passes in, if at all within a small
    k. That's very likely part of why Extension A's fitted exponents
    (~2.5) came in well below the theoretical O(k^6) -- the experiment
    itself was accidentally too gentle.

    This fixes that by seeding `TopUp` with a genuinely adversarial starting
    plan instead of an empty one: half the pool (chosen by interleaving on
    mass, not just taking a low/high split, so the seeded units still
    represent the whole pool's mass distribution rather than being all
    lightweight) is pre-split into single-unit trips before `TopUp` ever
    runs. That means `current` already has real trips to scan on the very
    first pass, and the code under test is otherwise identical -- same
    `ext_top_up_plan`, same instance-building logic, same facility. Two
    fresh `inst` objects are built per k (one for each timed call) rather
    than reusing one, specifically so the per-trip memoisation cache
    (`ext_build_inst`'s wrapped `best_order`/`trip_cost`) can't let whichever
    variant runs second silently ride on the first run's warmed-up cache. And
    because this seeded-start approach is so much cheaper per pass than
    Extension A's empty-start version, the sweep can run all the way to
    k=30 -- this facility's actual full size -- rather than stopping at 14.

    ## Extension O -- Pushing Past k=30 With a Synthetic Instance

    This facility only has 30 supply units in total, which is a hard
    ceiling Extension N can't get past no matter how adversarial its
    starting plan is -- there simply isn't a k=100 or k=200 version of this
    specific facility to test against. But `ext_top_up_plan` never actually
    touches the real facility's globals directly; every single thing it
    reads goes through the generic `inst` dictionary interface --
    `inst["MASS"]`, `inst["dist"]`, `inst["best_order"]`, `inst["CAP"]`, and
    so on. That means any object matching that same interface is a valid
    input, whether or not it came from `get_facility` at all.

    So this section builds a fully fabricated instance instead: random 2D
    Euclidean positions standing in for corridor distances (there's no real
    maze here, just straight-line distance between random points -- that's
    deliberate, since the point of this test is to stress `TopUp`'s
    combinatorics, not to model a believable facility), random mass and
    value drawn from the same ranges the real generator uses, and the same
    `CAP`. Critically, `k` -- the number of supply nodes -- is now a free
    parameter with no ceiling, so this can run the identical
    fragmented-vs-empty comparison Extension N ran, at sizes far beyond
    anything the actual facility could ever produce.

    Same experiment as Extension N, same two starting-plan conditions, just
    run on the fabricated instance above instead of the real facility, at
    k values stretching from 10 all the way to 200 -- roughly 6.7x this
    facility's own full supply count. Both axes are log-scaled, since the
    range of both k and runtime spans more than an order of magnitude.

    Fitted growth on a synthetic instance, same construction as Extension N:
    fragmented ~ **k^{_b_adv:.2f}**, empty ~ **k^{_b_emp:.2f}** -- steeper
    again than Extension N's already-steeper-than-A fit, since a larger k
    range gives the true asymptotic growth more room to dominate the fixed
    per-call overhead that flattens a curve's *apparent* exponent when it's
    only measured over a narrow range (exactly the effect Extension J
    discusses for the exact solver's own runtime curve). Doubling k from
    100 to 200 multiplies runtime by roughly **{_ratio:.0f}x** -- for
    comparison, a clean O(k^6) relationship would predict 2^6=64x from a
    doubling, so this measured ratio is consistent with genuinely
    high-order polynomial growth, not just noise. At k=200 the fragmented
    variant takes **{_k200['adversarial_ms']/1000:.0f} seconds** for a
    single `TopUp` call -- on a facility of this notebook's real size (30),
    the same call finishes in milliseconds. That gap is the entire, concrete
    case for why `TopUp` being uncapped is a genuine design risk rather than
    an abstract complexity-theory concern: nothing about the code prevents
    it from being run on a larger problem someday, and when it is, this is
    what the uncapped version actually costs.
