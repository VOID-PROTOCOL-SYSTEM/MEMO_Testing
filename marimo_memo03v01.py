    > **Field update -- three things have changed.**
    >
    > **1. Carried mass now costs energy.** A corridor of stability weight `w`
    > traversed while carrying total mass `L` costs `w x (1 + L)`.
    >
    > **2. CRUDY-1 cannot lift the whole payload.** It has a **mass capacity of
    > C = 5 units**. The entry shaft is now the **extraction point**: CRUDY-1
    > descends, collects up to C mass units, returns to the shaft, deposits its
    > load (carried mass resets to 0), and descends again. At the end it must
    > reach an exit under its own power.
    >
    > **3. The operation is energy-limited.** A total battery budget `B` covers
    > the whole operation, including the final run to an exit. `B` is about 60%
    > of what full extraction costs, so **you cannot take everything**. The
    > directive is to **maximise priority value delivered within `B`**.

    **This workbook is issued complete.** All six actions are below. There are
    two submission points; the whole problem is visible from the start.

    # [M3-1] Improved Data Model & Algorithm
    ### Criterion 8 -- 300-500 words

    Design an improved **data model and algorithm combination** that correctly
    handles load-sensitive, capacity-constrained, **energy-limited** extraction.

    **The revised problem contains four decisions. Name the technique you apply
    to each, and say why it suits that decision.**

    | Decision | Question |
    |---|---|
    | **Selection** | which units are worth extracting at all, given `B`? |
    | **Grouping** | which units travel together in one trip, subject to `C`? |
    | **Ordering** | in what sequence within a trip, given mass accumulates? |
    | **Routing** | which corridors between consecutive collection points? |

    These interact. A unit worth taking on its own may not be worth taking once
    you account for the trip it forces you to fly.

    **Available helpers** -- use these rather than re-implementing the cost model:

    ```python
    SUPPLIES            # list of all supply unit nodes
    MASS[u], VALUE[u]   # mass and priority of unit u
    CAP                 # mass capacity (5)
    SHAFT, EXITS        # extraction shaft, exit nodes
    dist(u, v)          # cheapest corridor cost u -> v, carrying nothing
    corridor_path(u, v) # the actual sector list behind dist(u, v)
    trip_cost(trip)     # load-aware energy for one shuttle (list of units)
    plan_cost(plan)     # total energy for a list of trips + final exit run
    plan_value(plan)    # total priority delivered
    validate_plan(plan, budget)  # (ok, problems) -- ALWAYS run before quoting
    best_order(units)   # cheapest order within one trip (brute force)
    ```

    A **plan** is a list of trips; a **trip** is a list of supply unit nodes, in
    collection order. For example: `[[s1, s7], [s3], [s2, s9, s4]]`.
